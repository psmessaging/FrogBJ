12-16-2024: True and Split shuffle implemented

More coming soon. Player Analytics, Chip Count, House Advantage Slider, Player's Card Integration, Multi Shoe Interaction, Dyanmic Adjustments... all coming soon.

Since this is a true riffle shuffle, you can see how this is sooooo realalistic. Goal of this project is to get close to Casino Realism as possible, with all the house levers and external integrations as possible.
