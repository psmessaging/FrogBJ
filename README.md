12-16-2024: True and Split shuffle implemented

More coming soon. Player Analytics, Chip Count, House Advantage Slider, Player's Card Integration, Multi Shoe Interaction, Dyanmic Adjustments... all coming soon.

Since this is a true riffle shuffle, you can see how this is sooooo realalistic. Goal of this project is to get close to Casino Realism as possible, with all the house levers and external integrations as possible.

03-06-2025: Random Shuffle Verification

Having confirmed that random numbers are not being used at most casinos with their machines that setup the cards for each shoe, as such the algorithm used in this FrogBJ is made so that all hands are not random, and setup to not have a chance either way sometimes of winning, just losing and taking the your wagered amount of money. Additionally, splits and double downs are always set for dealer to obtain a push or win with a total card value of 21.
